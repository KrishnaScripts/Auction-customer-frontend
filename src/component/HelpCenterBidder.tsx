EACH AUCTION MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TERMS THAT ARE NOT LISTED HERE. IT IS THE BIDDER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO EACH AUCTION’S TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRIOR TO SUBMITTING ANY/ALL BIDS. Violation of the terms and conditions of an auction is grounds for immediate bidding suspension without notice.</p>
                                    <p>The below terms are subject to change by auction.</p>

                                    <h6 className="text-dark fs-20">Equipment Sold “As Is, Where IS”</h6>
                                    <p>All equipment /property is sold “AS IS, WHERE IS” with no warranty or guarantees, expressed or implied, by the Seller or DPA Auctions for items sold. ALL SALES ARE FINAL. Inspection of the property/equipment before bidding is strongly recommended. Verbal or written descriptions from the Seller or DPA Auctions are not guaranteed. Bidders are responsible for inspection of the items and will not be issued a rebate or refund for any reason. It is the responsibility of the Buyer to conduct any inspection and examination necessary to satisfy themselves of all material facts before placing any/all bids. Location of the equipment and the Seller’s contact information will be provided within the description of each item for sale.</p>
                                    <p>Bidders accept all auction items/property “WITH ALL FAULTS”, whether or not immediately apparent. Bidders are responsible for assessing actual current condition of the item(s)/property through personal inspection and careful review of the description, picture(s), and/or support documentation. Every Bidder agrees that by placing a bid and the amount that they bid, has been based solely on their own independent inspection and evaluation of the auction item.</p>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h6 className="text-dark fs-20">Equipment Inspection</h6>
                                    <p>No testing or operational assessments have been made by DPA Auctions. DPA Auctions’ employees and representatives are not professional photographers. Photos may or may not depict all the positives and negatives of an item. These photos and descriptions are to be used as a guideline only. All Bidders are responsible for their own personal inspection of the item(s).</p>
                                    <p>DPA Auctions’ employees and representatives only report hours and mileage that are shown on the equipment at the time of listing for an auction and are assumed to be correct. However, these assumptions do not constitute a guarantee. DPA Auctions makes no guarantee that the hours and mileage shown on equipment are the actual hours/mileage. It is up to the Bidder to validate the accuracy of the hours/mileage during the inspection process and before placing any/all bids.</p>
                                    <p>DPA Auctions is not responsible for written or verbal statements made by the Seller. Bidder’s should carefully validate all written or verbal statements before placing any/all bids. Seller’s contact information and location of the item will be provided for each piece of equipment. Exact location of the equipment will be provided by the Seller when contacted.</p>
                                    <p>In no event does failure to contact the Seller serve as grounds for negating a sale, retracting any bids, or providing any rebates or refunds of any kind.</p>

                                    <h6 className="text-dark fs-20">Auction Software</h6>
                                    <p>DPA Auctions will not be held liable for any software malfunction discrepancies. DPA Auctions does not guarantee safe and secure access to DPAauctions.com. DPA Auctions is not liable or responsible for any interruptions or terminations of any online feed or other internet registration, bidding, or any other online-related services that occur before or during any online or onsite auction, regardless of the fault or cause. The Bidder agrees to hold DPA Auctions harmless for any such discrepancies or the Bidder’s inability to use or access DPAauctions.com. DPA Auctions has full discretion to modify the date, time, order, and details of any item at any time for any reason, including but not limited to technical issues, emergencies, or discretion of DPA Auctions or the Seller. At the sole discretion of DPA Auctions, the auction may be suspended, postponed, or canceled if internet service is unstable or disrupts the online portion of the auction.</p>

                                    <h6 className="text-dark fs-20">Internet Bidding</h6>
                                    <p>The highest bid online when the bidding closes will be the winning Bidder for that item. If the item has a posted RESERVE price, a sale will only occur if the reserve price for that item has reached the pre-determined reserve amount, in which case the verbiage online will reflect during the bidding process. If in fact the RESERVE price is NOT MET, a sale will not occur. Any bidding within the last 60 seconds before the determined closing time of an item will extend the bidding by an additional 60 seconds (bidding extension time may be subject to change per auction). Be prepared to bid accordingly.</p>

                                    <h6 className="text-dark fs-20">Taxes</h6>
                                    <p>DPA Auctions is required by law to collect sales tax on all applicable transactions. Tax rates will be based on the item’s location. Tax will be collected on all applicable items unless the Buyer provides proof of a tax exemption. This proof of tax exemption must be submitted before tax amounts will be removed from the invoice. Law requires that exemption forms be auction specific and will need to be completed for each individual auction. DPA Auctions cannot offer advice, opinions or guarantees about whether a Bidder is, in fact, tax exempt. For eligibility questions, please contact your tax consultant. DPA Auctions will not be held liable for States’ registration requirements regarding exemptions. Guidelines and regulations regarding tax exemptions may vary between states. If you are eligible for an exemption, please complete the appropriate exemption certificate and email it to customer.service@DPAauctions.com or fax it to 402-721-4583.</p>
